// collection is basically group of object, to store the group of object
// we go for collection concept	
// to process the data/objects from the collection we used streams concept	

// Que) how streams process the data from the collection ?
	
// Ans:=> for that streams provided various numbers of methods and different mechanism also	
// to process the objects from the collection streams provide 2 mechanism
// 1) filter
// 2) map	
	
//  1) filter	
// 	We have collection of array list, based on certain condition we will filter the whole data from collections and 
//	store the data in some other collection, or use it for some other purpose
//  In case of filter data will be reduce.
	
//  2) map
//  we will get each and every object from the collection, we will apply certain operation on each and every element and 
//	result will be stored in some other collection or use it for some other purpose	
//  In case of map data may not be reduce.


//  we have few numbers of objects in collections, we don't process the data directly  
//  in the collection, it is a source, we will add this data objects into the stream and
//	we will apply all the mechanism on the streaming element once you added/join the element 
//	in the stream then we can apply filter, map and some other methods on this particular data,
//	but the source will remains same, we were not modifying the source.
