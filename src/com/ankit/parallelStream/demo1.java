//Parallel Stream
	
//  The powerful feature of stream is that stream pipelines may execute 
//	either sequentially or in parallel. All connections support the parallelStream() method 
//	that returns a possible parallel stream:
	
//	Stream<Student>parallelStream = studentlist.parallelStream(;)

//  When a stream executes in parallel,	the java runtime divides the stream into multiple sub streams. 
//	the aggregate operations iterate over and process these sub streams in parallel and then combine the results.
	
//  stream = sub stream   sub stream   sub stream
